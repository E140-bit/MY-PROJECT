#Chatbot Project

Overview
The Chatbot Project is a simple yet powerful AI-driven chatbot built using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The chatbot is designed to recognize user inputs, predict their intents, and respond appropriately based on predefined patterns and responses. The project leverages NLTK for text processing and includes a Flask web application for easy deployment.
