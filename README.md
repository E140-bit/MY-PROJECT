**Chatbot Project**
This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple rule-based chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a neural network model built with TensorFlow. The chatbot is trained to recognize basic intents, such as greetings and farewells, and respond with predefined messages.

Features
Dataset: A JSON-based dataset (intents.json) containing intents, patterns, and responses.
Preprocessing: Tokenization and lemmatization of input text for creating a Bag-of-Words model.
Neural Network: A multi-layer perceptron model for intent classification.
Interactive Responses: Generates responses based on predicted intents.
Extensibility: Easy to expand with more intents, patterns, and responses.
Tech Stack
Python Libraries:
NLTK for text preprocessing
TensorFlow for training the model
NumPy for data manipulation
Flask (optional, for deployment)
Dataset Format: JSON
Model: Dense Neural Network with softmax activation for multi-class classification.
Usage
Training: Preprocess data and train the model to classify intents.
Response Generation: Predict intents based on user input and generate responses.
Deployment: The chatbot can be deployed using Flask or any web framework for real-time interaction.
Future Enhancements
Integration with state-of-the-art models like GPT for better context handling.
Support for multilingual interactions.
Deployment as a web-based chatbot or integration into messaging platforms.
How to Run
Clone the repository and follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the README.md.
Train the model and start interacting with the chatbot through the terminal.
Feel free to fork the project and contribute enhancements!

About
